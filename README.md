# 100_DAYS_RTL Coding
Starting my 100 days RTL coding challenge 
just to have discipline and consistency in VLSI domain starting this challenge right from basics to advanced 
If anyone finds this useful and likes my consistency please consider me for opportunity in VLSI domain

##### google docs link for schematic and waveforms of these codes :-

#### Day-01 basic gates
    Basic gates are foundation of any digital circuits and yes they are used in almost every digital circuitary
#### Day-02 half adder and half subtractor
    The basic adder and the basic subtractor used for addition and subtraction of bits 
#### Day-03 full adder and full subtractor
    full adder can be indpendently or by using two half adders and or instantiating the half adder module etc., the similartiy is also seen in the full subtractor 
#### Day-04 multiplexer 8 inputs 
    Mux refers to a circuit where we use n select lines to take one input of 2^n inputs and give it as a output 
#### Day-05 four bit adder using one bit adder 
    This is basically extension of a one bit adder as an application I have used this one bit adder to make four bit adder which takes four bits as inputs and performs calculation 
#### Day-06 four bit ripple carry adder
#### Day-07 alu four bit
    ALU refers to Arithemetic and logical unit which as the name itself gives the description for the module ALU which is a integral part of CPU 
    it basically performs arithemetic and logical operations which is a must in a 
#### Day-08 Carry look ahead adder
#### Day-09 encoder 8:3 
#### Day-10 Decoder and Demux
