# 100_DAYS_RTL Coding
Starting my 100 days RTL coding challenge 
just to have discipline and consistency in VLSI domain starting this challenge right from basics to advanced 
If anyone finds this useful and likes my consistency please consider me for opportunity in VLSI domain

#### Day-01 basic gates
    Basic gates are foundation of any digital circuits and 
    yes they are used in almost every digital circuitary
#### Day-02 half adder and half subtractor
    The basic adder and the basic subtractor 
    used for addition and subtraction of bits 
#### Day-03 full adder and full subtractor
    full adder can be indpendently or by using two half adders and 
    or instantiating the half adder module etc., 
    the similartiy is also seen in the full subtractor 
#### Day-04 multiplexer 8 inputs 
    Mux refers to a circuit where we use n select 
    lines to take one input of 2^n inputs and give it as a output 
#### Day-05 four bit adder using one bit adder 
    This is basically extension of a one bit adder as an application 
    I have used this one bit adder to make four bit adder which 
    takes four bits as inputs and performs calculation 
#### Day-06 four bit ripple carry adder
    four-bit ripple carry adder, a fundamental digital circuit that performs 
    binary addition of two 4-bit numbers. The design showcases basic principles 
    of digital logic and is essential for understanding more complex arithmetic circuits.
#### Day-07 alu four bit
    ALU refers to Arithemetic and logical unit which as the name itself 
    gives the description for the module ALU which is a integral part of CPU 
    it basically performs arithemetic and logical operations which is a must in a 
#### Day-08 Carry look ahead adder
    a high-speed digital circuit that efficiently adds two binary
    numbers by reducing the propagation delay caused by carry bits.
#### Day-09 encoder 8:3 
    a digital circuit that converts one of eight active inputs into a corresponding 3-bit binary code.
#### Day-10 Decoder and Demux
    # decoder, a digital circuit that converts binary-coded inputs into a unique set of outputs,
        typically used for selecting specific memory addresses.
    # demultiplexer (demux), a digital circuit that takes a single input and 
    routes it to one of several outputs, based on a set of select lines.
#### Day-11 Simple Communication System  {Applied day-1 to day-10}
     a simple communication system using Verilog, incorporating an encoder, decoder,
     multiplexer (mux), and demultiplexer (demux) to facilitate efficient data transmission and reception.
#### Day-12 D Type Flip-Flop 
     a D-type flip-flop, a digital storage element that captures and stores a 
     single bit of data on the rising or falling edge of a clock signal.
#### Day-13 JK Flip-Flop
    This project implements a JK flip-flop, a versatile digital storage element that can operate as a 
    set-reset flip-flop, toggle flip-flop, or hold state, based on its input conditions and clock signal.
#### Day-14 SR Flip-Flop 
    SR (Set-Reset) flip-flop is a basic sequential logic circuit with two inputs, S (Set) and R (Reset),
    that controls a single output, Q. It sets Q to 1 when S=1 and R=0, resets Q to 0 when S=0 and R=1, 
    and maintains its state when S=0 and R=0; the state when S=1 and R=1 is considered invalid.
