All the electronics works on logic and it may be a high logic [1] 
or it can be a low logic [0] in almost every scenario
but logic gates are kind of those gates which are a key role in builing big electronic cricuits in digital electronics and 
yes we can't ignore as they are meant to be the fondation of this while building most of circuits 
they are as follows
NOT= used for getting opposite logic
AND = used for getting logic high when both inputs are high
