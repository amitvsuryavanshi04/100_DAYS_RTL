All the electronics works on logic and it may be a high logic [1] 
or it can be a low logic [0] in almost every scenario
but logic gates are kind of those gates which are a key role in builing big electronic cricuits in digital electronics and 
yes we can't ignore as they are meant to be the fondation of this while building most of circuits 
they are as follows
NOT= used for getting opposite logic
AND = used for getting logic high when both inputs are high
NAND = it's just opposite of AND gate
OR = acts like logical adder gives output high when one of the input is high
NOR = acts opposite of OR gate
XOR = it's exclusive OR gate when inputs are same output is zero/low [0]
XNOR = it's opposite of XOR gate
